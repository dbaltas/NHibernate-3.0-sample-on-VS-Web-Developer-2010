Sample Nhibernate 3.0 Application on VS2010

This project can only be of use to developers who are new to NHibernate and 
followed the Getting Started Guide from nhforge.org at 
http://nhforge.org/wikis/howtonh/your-first-nhibernate-based-application.aspx


Using:
NHibernate 3.0.0 Beta 
Visual Studio 2010 Web Developer Express
NUNit 2.5.7 is used for the tests project.
SQL Server 2005 as Database Engine (instead of MS SQL Server Compact Edition described in tutorial)

To run successfully from NUnit, dlls should be copied 
from \HiberLib\References
to \HiberLib.Tests\bin\Debug
NOTE: there is no need to copy these dlls if your references to NHibernate.dll are from the NHibernate installation directory.
